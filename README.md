Flux = Network Scheduling in the Dark
==================================

Flux determines flow sizes in advance without changing applications.

We provide a simulator that can test effects of inaccurate flow size predictions on system performance.
The simulator is a fork of YAPS(https://github.com/NetSys/simulator)
